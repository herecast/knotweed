TRORC is working with the Public Service Department and the Vermont Energy Investment Corporation (VEIC) to develop a plan based on Vermont's energy goal of obtaining 90% of its energy across all sectors-transportation, space heating and cooling, and electricity-from renewable sources by 2050.

TRORC will be holding two initial meetings in different parts of our region to present background information on the project, discuss analysis of renewable energy potential in our region, and solicit public input on the siting of new renewable energy projects.

* EXPLORE DATA on current energy usage and future projected need in our region.
* REVIEW MAPS showing analysis of regional energy generation potential.
* DISCUSS SITING Provide input on the siting of renewable energy generation infrastructure.

For more information, please contact: Dee Gish or Chris Sargent * dgish@trorc.org * csargent@trorc.org * (802) 457-3188
