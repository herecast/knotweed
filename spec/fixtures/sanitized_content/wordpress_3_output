<br /><p>As artistic director for Northern Stage, Carol Dunne is responsible for the artistic and production arms of the company. She sets the artistic tone for the entire organization, from what plays should be produced each season to who would be best suited to direct and act in a particular production. An accomplished actor and director in her own right, Carol works with the team on staff to make the visions for a particular show or season come into reality, working within the given circumstances of budgets, time, and human resources. Here are her answers to four questions about her life and work.</p><br /><p><strong>How and when did you get started in this line of work?</strong></p><br /><p>I got into the theater as a kid who loved singing and dancing. When I went to college my love of the art form deepened and I committed myself to a life as an actress upon graduation. I lived in New York, traveled as an actress, and ended up directing plays in my thirties, always wanting to grow my knowledge of the art form.  I started running theaters at the age of 42. ... I'm the Julia Child of Artistic Directors!</p><br /><p><strong>What's the best thing about it?</strong></p><br /><p>I recognize the deep truth that the arts, mankind's expression of what it is to be human, make our world a much more beautiful, enlightened and thrilling place.  I get to work every day to make the arts a joyous part of peoples' lives.</p><br /><p><strong>What's the most challenging aspect of it?</strong></p><br /><p>The brilliant playwright Tom Stoppard once said "Love is knowing and being known."  To love the theater, you have to have been introduced to the theater, in all of its forms.  You have to know plays and musicals, classics and comedies, to get the most out of them.  And if a child was not raised with theater, they become a grownup who is perhaps not able to take the financial risk to attend something they do not know.  The challenge is to make theater exciting and accessible to our audiences so that they wish to know it on a deeper, more fulfilling level.  But we have seen the power of theater to change lives, so we changed Northern Stage's mission to:  Changing lives one story at a time ...<br /><div><strong>What's your favorite Upper Valley thing to do on a day off?</strong></div><br /><div></div><br />I am a passionate, passionate bicyclist.  I love to ride around back roads and just see the beauty that surrounds us.  It's an incredible antidote to the life of the theater .... days and days in a dark space.  I learned to bike up hills at 40 when my friend coached me and wouldn't let me get off the bike and walk. She was tough, but taught me to love the ups and downs ... of it all!</p><br /><p><img class="size-full wp-image-3548" src="https://knotweed.s3.amazonaws.com/content/792142/L1020445.jpg" alt="Construction is wrapping up on the new Northern Stage theater, due to open with this fall's season." width="3264" height="2448"><div class="image-caption"><p>Construction is wrapping up on the new Northern Stage theater, due to open with this fall's season.</p></div></p><br />
