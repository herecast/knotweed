She is a shy but strong girl who dreams of becoming an astronaut, who is interested in woodwork at a time when shop class was open only to boys, and wants to be accepted for herself -- not seen as odd because her father is African-American and her mother Japanese.</p><br /><p>Written in verse, this is the story of family, friendship, and self-discovery that sheds a gentle light on the intentional and unintentional bigotry in our culture."</p><br /><p>For more staff picks, please visit <a href="http://norwichbookstore.com/" target="_blank">norwichbookstore.com</a>.
