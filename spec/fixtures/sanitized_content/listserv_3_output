<div><br /><div><br /><div><br /><div>This coming winter kids in 7 towns around the Upper Valley will be traveling the Silk Road through story, song, dance, food and arts and crafts.  One goal of the Revels Kids program is to involve people in our local communities who have some sort of connection to or knowledge of the cultures we study.  The idea is to connect kids to the people in their communities in new ways as they learn about the culture we are studying.<br /></div>Did you grow up or live in one of the countries along the Silk Road? Do you have special knowledge or interest in one of these cultures?  Perhaps you speak or teach Chinese?  Or maybe you have lived in Turkey and have special items to share with kids that speak to that culture.   Perhaps Middle Eastern cuisine is a specialty of yours.  Are you a storyteller?  Maybe you are a librarian, and know of great resources in your community library that you would like to share.  The possibilities are endless!<br /></div>Consider sharing your knowledge and interest with the Revels Kids group in your area. The sites for our 2016 Revels Kids program include St. Johnsbury, Bradford, Vershire, Norwich, and Pomfret in Vermont, and Haverhill and West Lebanon in New Hampshire.<br /></div>Please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:craft@revelsnorth.org">craft@revelsnorth.org</a> and I will let you know who is teaching at the Revels Kids site in your community.  We look forward to meeting you!<br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><br /><div><div><div><br />-- <br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><br /><div>Laura Craft<br>Children's Chorus Manager, Christmas Revels <br>Company Manager, Revels North<br></p><br /><p>Summer Revels Production Co-Manager<br><a href="http://www.revelsnorth.org" target="_blank">craft@revelsnorth.org</a><br><a href="http://www.revelsnorth.org" target="_blank">www.revelsnorth.org</a> <br /></div><br /><p>Bringing Traditions To Life</p><br /><div><br></div><br /><b><img src="http://revelsnorth.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Revels-logo-40-years.jpg" height="72" width="96"></b><br /></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><br /></div></div></div><br /></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><br /></div><br /><div><br /></div>
