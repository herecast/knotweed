"<p>\n<div><br /><span>Looking for a long-term house sitter? </span><br><span>29-year-old yoga-teaching, good-food-cooking, self-helpy-book-reading, introvert-at-heart who only plans to be in the area through this fall &amp; winter is looking for housing starting ASAP in the Upper Valley. </span><br><span>I am not looking to get locked into a lease with another apartment &amp; all that hoopla, but am trying to find a way to be able to stay in the area for a few more months. So I am looking for a house-sitting opportunity through the fall &amp; winter where I can be of help to someone else while simultaneously having a roof over my head!</span><br><span>I can provide excellent references, as well as the promise to keep your happy home in excellent condition while you're away - and even look after pets as needed. (A furry friend to snuggle once the snow flies would be very welcome!)</span><br><span>If you - or someone you know - has an opportunity that would suit this, please reach out! I'll look forward to hearing from you :) </span><br><span>&lt;&lt; If you happen to know of a month-by-month VERY low-cost rental opportunity I would love to hear about it too! Greatly appreciate your help! &gt;&gt;</span><br /></div><br /><div><br /></div>\n</p>"
