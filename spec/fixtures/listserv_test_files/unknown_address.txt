Lake Shore Greeters: Lake Fairlee
The Lake Fairlee Association is interviewing persons interested in being
Greeters at the State Boat Ramp on Lake Fairlee. Greeters' job includes
welcoming boaters to the lake, informing them about invasive plants and
animals, about sensible rules of lake use, and about the Lake Fairlee
Association. Greeters inspect all water craft entering and leaving the lake
looking for invasives. Careful record keeping is required. Attendance to a
State-run training program for Greeters in late May is required. The time
commitment is between 17 and 23 hours per week for 15 weeks beginning in
late May. $12/hour.  Applicants should be 18 or over. Please send your
statement of interest and a resume to Renee Snow  reneelsnow@gmail.com
