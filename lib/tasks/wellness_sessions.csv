215,Advance Care Planning: Let's Talk About It!,4/16/15 10:00,4/16/15 11:30,Aging well,"<p>Leader: Maria Koehler</p>
<p>If you were unable to speak for yourself, who would make decisions on your behalf? Would they know what type of decisions you would want them making? Would they know your health care goals, values and beliefs? Putting your wishes in writing in the form of an Advance Directive is important, but we need go a step further. Having conversations with your appointed health care agents well in advance of a health care crisis will better prepare them for the future. Please join Maria Koehler of the Office of Care Management and Honoring Care Decisions as we discuss the importance of Advance Directives (AD) and Advance Care Planning (ACP), explain common misconceptions and benefits to advance care planning and provide you with an opportunity to engage in a conversation and complete the AD documents if you are ready.</p>

922,Car Seat and Recycling and Safety Event,5/16/15 10:00,5/16/15 13:00,Parenting,"Parking Lot 20 (Look for the signs!)<br /><br />Did you know that every infant car seat and child booster carries an expiration date, usually marked somewhere on the seat&rsquo;s labeling? If only a manufacture date is shown, the guideline is that its expiration is six years from that date. Because car seats are made of plastic, which becomes brittle and can develop cracks over time, they lose their effectiveness year by year. Since there are very few recycling programs in effect nationwide, most seats are disposed of with the regular trash.&nbsp;<br /><br />Manufacturers recommend disassembling and destroying the seats so that no one else will pick up and reuse them, thinking they&rsquo;re safe. This year we will be joined by the Lebanon Police Department, members of the Lebanon Fire Department and Lebanon Professional Fire Fighters Association, who welcome the opportunity to show families the equipment that is used to help keep our community safe. You will be able to participate in fire extinguisher and other hands on demonstrations.&nbsp;<br /><br />Please call the WHRC at 603.650.2600 for more information on this community event.

This change in scientific climate has deep implications for all aspects of our culture&mdash;from health care reform to education to our own family relationships. With a clearer vision of how early experience forms the brain, we&mdash;as individuals and as a community&mdash;can more intelligently invest our energy in the robust relationships that help infants and toddlers thrive. Join us for a 45-minute lecture by Dr. Schore, followed by a 45-minute discussion. <br /><br />This event is designed for all who care about children&rsquo;s development, from policy makers to parents. Bring your questions about how brain science applies to our community&rsquo;s children. Co-sponsored by the Early Childhood Mental Health Network of the Upper Valley, CHaD, and Let&rsquo;s Grow Kids.

1304,Kirtan,6/26/15 19:30,6/26/15 21:00,"Mind and body, Yoga","Kirtan (&ldquo;Kheer-tawn&rdquo;) is a companion to the practices of yoga and meditation. &nbsp;These practices increase our self discipline and self awareness as we work to remove stiffness &nbsp;and stagnation from the body and mind. These practices are not religious and no specific dogma is followed or preached, but they are spiritual in nature. Everyone is encouraged to join in during the Kirtan, making the practice &nbsp;a &ldquo;co-formance&rdquo; where the group becomes a part of the band. During the &ldquo;co-formance&rdquo;, a Kirtan walla, or chant leader, will sing out a line and the &nbsp;group sings it back. These lines are repeated until they become integrated into the chanters&rsquo; consciousness. The chant usually rises in speed, building momentum and vibrational energy, &nbsp;and then the chant slows down. Rather than applauding between songs a moment of mindful silence and reflection follows the chant to allow the effects to settle in the body and spirit. At Upper Valley Yoga Kirtan is lead by Angie and her husband Josh, and often other musicians. Kirtan is generally held the last Friday of the month, from 7:30 to 9 pm, and there is no sign up and no charge, but a suggested donation of $15 is gratefully accepted. Donations are divided equally between musicians and the studio; all studio portions are donated toward the Karma Fund.",,Angie Follensbee-Hall (Powerful Woman Yoga),Upper Valley Yoga,593,"58 N.

<p>""Tell all the truth,"" wrote Emily Dickinson, ""but tell it slant."" Poetry, through wordplay and its various forms, allows us to experiment artfully with the matter of life-our loves and losses, fears and dreams, and every mundane thing in between&mdash;so as to give it better resonance, a heightened urgency, and a timeless quality. In this class, our reading and discussion of good poems will frame in-class writing exercises and the creation and sharing of our own good poems.</p>

During the practice days, sitting meditation went from morning to evening, and during study periods in addition to the main course taught by the Vidyadhara, there were also courses taught by his students. The basic overarching structure of each seminary was the same: the journey through the three yanas, or three stages of the path. There were thirteen seminaries in all, in which Trungpa Rinpoche gave more than 300 talks. The material in these talks forms the basis of the three Profound Treasury volumes.</p>

For some, it is a gradual shift and for others, a radical metamorphosis, nothing short of a tsunami. Menopause is a time of physical, emotional and psychological change and the topic is increasingly relevant to a larger percentage of our population; however, the information provided can be confusing and women struggle to determine what is applicable to their lives. Join us to discuss the physiology behind perimenopause/menopause and the common signs and symptoms. We will also explore evidence-based treatment options and lifestyle changes that aim to improve your wellbeing through this transition. There will be plenty of time for questions and answers to make this as personalized as possible for you.
